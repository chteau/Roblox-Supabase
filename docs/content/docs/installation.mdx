# Prerequisites

To install **Roblox Supabase** on your projects, you need to make sure you have the following:
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project set up.
- Your Supabase project `API_URL` and `API_KEY`.

<Callout title="HTTP Requests disclaimer" type="warn">
    Make sure you activated HTTP requests on your Roblox project or any requests to the PostgreSQL endpoint of your Supabase project will fail.

    [See more details](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud-services/http-service#enable-http-requests).
</Callout>

These are the only steps you must make sure you follow to install **Roblox Supabase** on your project.

# Installation

### Manual Installation

If you prefer installing manually, please follow the steps below:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Download the `.rbxm` file from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/chteau/Roblox-Supabase/releases/latest) accessible from the Roblox Supabase repository.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Drag and drop the file into your Roblox Studio project.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Place the **"Supabase"** ModuleScript in the `ServerStorage` of your project.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Git Submodules

In order to install **Roblox Supabase** using git submodules, make sure:
- You are using `Rojo` (or an alternative).
- That `git` is installed on your computer.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Go to your project's folder and start a new CLI.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        In your CLI, enter this command:

        ```bash
        git submodule add https://github.com/chteau/Roblox-Supabase.git
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Update your [Rojo configuration file](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/project-format/) to point to the appropriate path and sync **Roblox Supabase** directly in your project.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout title="Update your submodule to get the latest changes." type="info">
    To keep **Roblox-Supabase** up to date with the latest changes, you can simply enter this command:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --remote
    ```
</Callout>

### Using Wally

You can find the package on [this link](https://wally.run/package/chteau/roblox-supabase).

Using wally, make sure that:
- Aftman is installed.
- Wally is initialized in your project.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        In `wally.toml`, add this line:

        ```toml
        [server-dependencies]
        roblox-supabase = "chteau/roblox-supabase@<THE_LATEST_VERSION>"
        ...
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        If you use **Rojo**, make sure that in your `default.project.json` file, you reference the `ServerPackage` folder in order for it to be replicated on your studio.
        (You don't have to put this in `ServerStorage`, but I recommend putting this in.) - See more on [this link](https://alexasterisk.github.io/WallyPackages/import/installation/#using-rojo).
        ```json
        {
            "name": "project-name"
            "tree": {
                "$className": "DataModel",
                ...
                "ServerStorage": {
                    "Packages": {
                        "$path": "ServerPackages"
                    }
                },
                ...
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        In your CLI, enter this command:

        ```bash
        wally install
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        You can now access **Roblox Supabase** in your server scripts using:
        ```lua
        local SS = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
        local Supabase = require(SS.Packages["roblox-supabase"])

        ...
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Initializing

Once **Roblox Supabase** placed in your Roblox project, you can just set-up a new client in order to use it.

```lua title="Script.luau"
local Supabase = require("<PATH_TO_SUPABASE>") -- By default, it should be available in "ServerStorage" directly.

-- Create a single client for interacting with your database
local client = Supabase.createClient({
    url = "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co",
    apiKey = "publishable-or-anon-key"
})
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    url: {
        description: "The unique Supabase URL which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.",
        type: "string",
        required: true,
    },
    apiKey: {
        description: "The unique Supabase Key which is supplied when you create a new project in your project dashboard.",
        type: "string",
        required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

<Callout title="Options are not supported yet." type="info">
    Options such as `accessToken`, `auth`, `db`, `global` and `realtime` are yet to be implemented.

    If you wish to contribute to the project, see [the contribution docs](/docs/contribute)
</Callout>

There you go! Now you should have a functional Supabase client inside of your Roblox project!
