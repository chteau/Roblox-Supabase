import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

# `from(tableName: string)`

The `from()` method is your entry point to database operations in Supabase. It selects a table from your PostgreSQL database and returns a query builder that enables you to construct and execute SQL queries using a fluent, chainable API.

---

## Parameters

<TypeTable
    type={{
        tableName: {
            type: 'string',
            description: 'The name of the database table to query. Must be accessible within your Supabase project schema.',
            required: true
        }
    }}
/>

## Return Value

The `from()` method returns a [**RootQuery**](/docs/types#rootquery) object, which serves as the foundation for building database queries.

## Usage

```lua title="Script.luau"
-- Assuming you've defined your Supabase client beforehand

local data, error = client
    :from("TableName")
    -- Then select the operation you want to execute (i.e. select, insert, update, delete)
```
